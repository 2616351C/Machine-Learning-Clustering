# Machine-Learning-Clustering ALgorithm
#Clustering is a task of grouping data points in a way that objects in the same cluster are similar to each other.
The best clustering model will best describe structure of data. 
Clustering Models: K Means, Gaussian Mixture Model, Hierarchical Clustering, Louvain Clustering

Dataset: 
5000 colorectal cancer tissue patches
it consists of 9 tissue types including
• Adipose (ADI)
• background (BACK)
• debris (DEB)
• lymphocytes (LYM)
• mucus (MUC)
• smooth muscle (MUS)
• normal colon mucosa (NORM)
• cancer-associated stroma (STR)
• colorectal adenocarcinoma 
epithelium (TUM)

Testing: 
CNN classifiers, trained on ImageNet dataset and achieve 74.9%, 77.9%, 71.3% accuracy- ResNet50, InceptionV3, VGG16.
state-of-the-art GAN-based model for tissue images, trained on an unsupervised manner - PathologyGAN
