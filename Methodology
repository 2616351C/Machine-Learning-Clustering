Using K-Means, GMM, Louvain, Hierarchical clustering methods to find out the best clustering method for model selection of cancer tissue patches
Testing of 4 different representations of tissue patches: PathologyGAN (5000 vectors of 200 dimension), ResNet50 (5000 vectors of 2048 dimension), InceptionV3 (5000 vectors of 2048 dimension), VGG16 (5000 vectors of 4096 dimension)
Two dimensionality reduction methods used for each set: PCA and UMAP (vector size 100)
